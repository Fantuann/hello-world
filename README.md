# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi Humans!

Fantuann here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript (that's what I'm made of!).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to Earth tacos.

Just joking!

I'm just a newcoming, learning stuffs about GitHub and trying to be part of this great job.
